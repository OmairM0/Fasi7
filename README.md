## 🌐 Live Demo (Note)

A live demo of Fasi7 may be available at [https://fasi7-tau.vercel.app/](https://fasi7-tau.vercel.app/),  
but the backend is hosted on Supabase free tier.  
If the site is inactive for a week, Supabase may pause the project,  
so the demo might not be accessible until the backend is resumed.
